# Image Slider Animation

This project showcases a **3D rotating image slider** with a **fixed image** at the bottom of the screen. The name is displayed above the image, and the entire design is created using HTML and CSS, making it lightweight and simple.

## Features

- **3D Image Slider**: Images rotate in a 3D effect on the page.
- **Fixed Bottom Image**: A fixed image (`11.png`) stays at the bottom center of the screen.
- **Centered Name**: Your name is displayed above the fixed image, centered horizontally.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).
