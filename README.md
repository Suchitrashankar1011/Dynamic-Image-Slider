# Dynamic Image Slider

The **Dynamic Image Slider** is a 3D image carousel built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This slider displays images in a rotating 3D effect and allows users to navigate through the items using left and right buttons. The background image changes dynamically based on the active image in the carousel.

## Features
- 3D rotating carousel effect with smooth transitions.
- Navigation buttons for moving between images.
- Background image changes based on the active carousel item.
- Scalable and customizable carousel layout.

## Files
- `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure and content for the image slider.
- `styles.css` - Contains the CSS styling for the carousel and its components.
- `script.js` - Handles the JavaScript functionality for the image slider.

## Getting Started

To view the **Dynamic Image Slider**, open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that the following images are available in the project directory:
- `1.png`
- `2.png`
- `3.png`

You can replace these images with your own. Just make sure they are placed in the same directory or adjust the paths in the HTML file accordingly.

## How It Works
1. **Carousel Animation**: The carousel items are positioned in 3D space using the `rotateY` property in CSS, creating a rotating effect.
2. **Active Item**: The active carousel item is highlighted by increasing its scale and opacity.
3. **Background Change**: The background of the page changes to match the active carousel item's image.
4. **Navigation**: The user can navigate through the carousel using the `prev` and `next` buttons to move between images.

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply download or clone the project and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to start using the image slider.
